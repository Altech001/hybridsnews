          <h3 class="h3-heading">Pepsi University Football League Returns for 10th Season</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          The Pepsi University Football League returns for its 10th season after a two-year hiatus due the government
          covid restrictions.
          Last played in March 2020 after schools were closed and sports activities in the country suspended, the
          University Football League was unable to resume due to the world's longest school closure. However, following
          the full reopening of the economy earlier this year, the league is now set to kick-off on Tuesday 5th April
          2022. Speaking at the launch of the 10th season, AUUS President, Kabenge Peninah said preparations have been
          ongoing
          and they are glad to finally be back to full action.
          "We have been working behind the scene to ensure the league returns sooner rather than later and I am glad
          that preparations are now complete and we are here today to launch our 10th season," Kabenge said.
          "We are particularly excited that what started with just 6 universities from around Kampala has since grown
          tremendously and today as we launch our 10th season of the Pepsi University Football League, 22 universities
          from across the entire country will be competing," Kabenge added.
          "As Pepsi we are all about football and music. And it is exciting today to be here to not only launch another
          season of the Pepsi University Football League but to celebrate 10 years of competition. Congratulations UFL,
          Congratulations AUUS and Congratulations Red Rhino on this milestone," Ssentongo said. On his part, Red Rhino
          Director Obal Atubo thanked AUUS and Pepsi and Nile Special for their partnership in
          supporting what has become an important national competition. <br>
          "I thank God that we are here today celebrating the 10th season of the Pepsi University Football League. This
          is something that we cannot take for granted and I give God all the praise and glory for this achievement. I
          also thank AUUS, all the participating universities, our sponsors Pepsi and Nile Special and others and FUFA
          for being a part of what has become an important national competition. We look forward to another 10 years of
          accelerated growth," Obal said.

        </a>

          League on April 17, 2024. Photo by Benjie
          Real Madrid exacted revenge on Manchester City to reach the Champions League semi-finals 4-3 on penalties
          after withstanding a barrage at the Etihad on Wednesday. Rodrigo gave the visitors an early lead before Kevin
          De Bruyne hit back for the holders to leave the level at 1-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate. <br>
          However, City's defense of the competition came to an end after Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic saw
          spot-kicks saved by Madrid's unlikely hero Andriy Lunin. The Ukrainian, who has deputized this season for the
          injured Thibaut Courtois, had been at fault for City's early opener in a thrilling first leg but more than
          made amends. <br>
          Madrid will face Bayern Munich in the last four after the German giants beat Arsenal 3-2 on aggregate. City
          had not lost at home in the Champions League since 2018 but the holders were held at bay by a heroic defensive
          effort by the 14-time European champions despite having 34 attempts on goal. <br>
          "It's so difficult. They are continuously probing with the ball and move you around. Most teams would fall
          apart when City get on top of you but we stood up really well," said Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham. "Today
          it came down to mentality.Unmute
          Madrid were blown away by an early City blitz in a 4-0 defeat at the Etihad 11 months ago as Pep Guardiola's
          men went on to win the competition for the first time. <br>
          City also edged a semi-final first leg thriller 4-3 on home soil two years ago only to be stunned by a late
          Madrid fightback in the return leg.
          "In other sports for the stats we would win but football is like this and it's marvelous," said Guardiola.
          "Congratulations to Madrid because their capacity to resist and defend till the end, they did so
          fantastically. We didn't manage to score in the final pass or final shot. "I don't have any regrets. Always we
          try to create more and concede less (than the opponent) and we did
          everything." <br>
